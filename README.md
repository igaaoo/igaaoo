<h3> About me: </h3>

üë®‚ÄçüíªI have always been passionate about technology, but it was in 2017 that I started my career in programming. I discovered myself in the world of coding, and since then, I haven't stopped developing and learning.

I learned the basics with Python, and shortly after, I started creating games in C#, where I spent 3 rewarding years studying the language and honing my skills. During this time, I created my most significant work, the Nautilus Simulator.

üåêEager for progress, I began studying Web development. React and Typescript have been my companions ever since. I learn quickly through hands-on experience, which is why I have several projects posted on GitHub. I recommend taking a look :)

üçÅMy biggest goal is to obtain Canadian citizenship and work as a developer there, while also balancing productivity and quality time through remote work (still searching for opportunities).

I believe in continuous progress, as obstacles are meant to be overcome.
